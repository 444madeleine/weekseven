        <!-- 3) DESCRIPTION (About info) -->
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p><strong>Built:</strong> The Staten Island Ferry, one of the last operating ferry systems in New York, transported people between Manhattan and its surrounding boroughs long before bridges were introduced. The northern shores of Staten Island were littered with piers, competing ferry companies vied for a place in the busy waters. Today, the Staten Island Ferry provides almost 22 million people with ferry service annually: taking almost 70,000 passengers daily between St George on Staten Island and Whitehall Street in Manhattan. </p>
